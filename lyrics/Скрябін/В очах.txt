Don’t you ever never understand me
I ride my byce all night and she said
Come with me together to the red birds
I’ll show you what I like and she said

Приспів:
Your eyes for my eyes...

I became too soon a very lonely
I miss you much all days
But I have to found a rather cold you
Tells about somewhere and just

Приспів

Working and walking by
And kissing and turning around
And working and waiting around
And just your eyes

Don’t you ever never understand me
I know your eyes and just
Could you ever never disappear
A lonely change
