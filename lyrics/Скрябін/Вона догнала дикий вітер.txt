So many voices I saw many voices
I call many voices I know you show me
No many voices I hate many voices

Draw many voices I hate many voices
I feel many voices

I know many voices I know you show
Call many voices I hate many voices
I know many voices I thought you call them
Show many voices I hate many voices
You breath many voices I hate you also
Call many voices you hate many voices
And hate many voices I know you show them
