I’m sitting here and looking from the strange window into the alien space
And I’m not recognizing any known star
I was wandering by all the roads wide and far
I had looked back and couldn’t see behind me a trace

But if I got a single pack of cigarettes
Well then things are not so bad up today.
And a ticket to the silver-winged plane
That’s taking off and leaving down only a shade.

And nobody wanted to be guilty with no gift
And nobody wanted to make a cat’s paw of a fly
But without music the death couldn’t be believed
But without music there’s no fun to die.

But if I got a single pack of cigarettes
Well then things are not so bad up today.
And a ticket to the silver-winged plane
That is taking off and leaving down only a shade.
