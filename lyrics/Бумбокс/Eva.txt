You change your make up nearly four times a day,
Learning old Frank Sinatra’s "My way", "My way".
House is clean and grass is green
I’ve got my freedom, freedom...
Like a fool I’m standing here
Stearing at your window

Приспів:
Sing in rain sing in joy and in pain
Bring me that sunshine.
Like a fool, like a guy from high school
Fell in love with you – joy of mine
And whatever ever Eva happens to the weather and now
Baby girl one thing I know for sure and more
We’ve got to be simply got to be...
simply got to be...

Oh, I wish I could have just something to say
But I don’t now this Shakespeare’s language of UK, of UK.
Ukraine is far just like you are
And I see clearly right now
The only chance to be a star so you could hear me.

In rain sing in joy and in pain
Bring me that sunshine
Like a fool like a guy from high school
I fell in love with you – joy of mine
And whatever ever ever ever Eva happens to the weather and now
Baby girl one thing I know for sure and more
We’ve got to be, you know, together.

Pardon me for the rhymes like ever – together...
I didn’t mean it...
